Goal: Create a new activity and set it to be the default activity.

Description:
Every activity in the project must be listed in AndroidManifest.xml, in the application node. Only one of them should contain an intent filter with an action set to MAIN and a category of LAUNCHER. That activity will be the default activity.

Directions:
1) Create a new activity.
  a) Click on File->New->Activity->Blank Activity
  b) The wizard will automatically create the activity, add it to AndroidManifest.xml, create a layout file, and create a menu file. If you want to delete an activity, you should remove the corresponding layout and menu file manually.
2) Modify the new activity's layout file so that you can recognize it as the second activity.
3) Modify AndroidManifest.xml to change the default activity.
4) Run the application and confirm that it starts with the second activity.
