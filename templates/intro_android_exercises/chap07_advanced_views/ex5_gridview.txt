Goal: Create a GridView to display 6 images.

Description:
Like ListView and Spinner, GridView is an adapter view. In other words, it displays the data that it finds in its attached adapter. In this exercise, we will display 6 images in a grid using a GridView.

Adapters can specify an XML file to display each item. However, to customize the view, one must subclass the ArrayAdapter class and override the getView method.

Directions:
1) Create a new Activity with a GridView that fills the entire screen.
2) Download and copy 6 images into the drawables folder. You only need to copy the images into one of the drawables folders.
3) Create a new class called GridImageAdapter that is a subclass of ArrayAdapter.
  a) Override the getView method to create a custom view.
  b) Set the appropriate image based on the index.
4) In the onCreate method, create a GridImageAdapter and set it to the GridView.


## Snippets

GridView gvImages;
GridImageAdapter adapter;

protected void loadGridViewImages() {
    gvImages = (GridView) findViewById(R.id.gvImages);
    String[] numbers = new String[] { "ad", "ae", "af", "ag", "ai", "al"};
    adapter = new GridImageAdapter(this,
        android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, numbers);
    gvImages.setAdapter(adapter);
}

class GridImageAdapter extends ArrayAdapter<String> {

  public GridImageAdapter(Context context, int textViewResourceId, String[] numbers) {
    super(context, textViewResourceId, numbers);
  }

  public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
      ImageView v = new ImageView(GridViewDemoActivity.this);
      int resId = getResources().getIdentifier(getItem(position), "drawable", getPackageName());
      v.setImageDrawable(getResources().getDrawable(resId));
      return v;
  }

}
