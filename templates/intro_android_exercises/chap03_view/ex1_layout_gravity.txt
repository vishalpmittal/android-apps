Goal: Explore layout gravity.

Description:
In Chapter 2, we explored the gravity property. Layout gravity specifies the gravity of an element with respect to its parent. The easiest way to understand this is to try a few layout gravity options and see what happens.

Directions:

1) Open the layout XML.
2) Add at least three TextViews in a vertical LinearLayout.
3) For each TextView, add the android:padding property and set it to 30dp. This will create some space between the TextViews.
4) Set the android:layout_gravity property of the first TextView to "left".
5) Set the android:layout_gravity property of the second TextView to "center".
6) Set the android:layout_gravity property of the third TextView to "right".


## Snippets

// In activity, have three TextViews similar to below
<TextView
    android:layout_gravity="center"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:padding="30dp"
    android:text="Gravity Center" />
