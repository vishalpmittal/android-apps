Goal: Explore the Activity lifecycle.

Description:
The Activity lifecycle is automatically managed by the Android framework. If a user taps on something that switches them into a new activity, the previous activity is paused. The activity is also paused if the user receives a phone call.

The 3 most commonly implemented activity lifecycle methods are onCreate, onPause, and onResume. Note: if you implement an activity lifecycle method, you MUST call the super implementation.

Directions:
1) Open the Activity java file (e.g., src/codepath/HelloWorldActivity.java)
2) Implement the onCreate, onPause, and onResume methods.
3) In each method, call the super method.
4) Add a Log.d message to each method, as shown below.
5) Run the application and observe the LogCat.
  a) In the emulator, click the Home button.  Did you see the activity pause in the LogCat?


## Snippets

protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_basic_text_view);
    Log.d("DEBUG", "onCreate was just called!");
}

protected void onResume() {
   super.onResume();
   Log.d("DEBUG", "onResume was just called!");
}

protected void onPause() {
   super.onPause();
   Log.d("DEBUG", "onPause was just called!");
}
