Goal: Explore the XML layout of an Activity.

Description:
Every activity has an associated XML layout file specified in the onCreate method. The XML file is responsible for describing the elements (TextViews, Buttons, etc) that will be on the screen for that activity.

Every element has XML properties that describes various behavior such as layout, alignment, color, etc.

Directions:

1) Open the XML layout file (e.g., res/layout/activity_hello_world.xml)
2) Switch to the text mode.
3) If there is not already a TextView in the layout, add one.
4) Modify the android:text property, as shown below.
