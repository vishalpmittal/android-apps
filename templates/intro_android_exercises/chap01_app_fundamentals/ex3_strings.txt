Goal: Modify strings in the strings.xml file.

Description:
The primary purpose of the strings.xml file is for internationalization. Any string that is ultimately shown to the user (e.g., in a text field, button, or navigation) should be added to the strings.xml file. That way, to add support for a new language simply requires adding an additional strings.xml file for the new language.

In XML, refer to strings described in the strings.xml file using the syntax @string/my_string.

Directions:

1) Open the XML layout file.
2) If you have any android:text values that do not refer to an @string, hover your mouse over the warning and read what it says.
3) Add new strings to the strings.xml file.  Note: the keys may not include spaces.
4) Modify all android:text properties to refer to a string
