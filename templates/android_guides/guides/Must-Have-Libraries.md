## Overview

There are many third-party libraries for Android but several of them are "must have" libraries that are extremely popular and are often used in almost any Android project. Each has different purposes but all of them make life as a developer much more pleasant. The major libraries are listed below in a few categories.

### Standard Pack

This "standard pack" listed below are libraries that are quite popular, widely applicable and should probably be setup within most Android apps:

| Name            | Description                                                 |  
| ----            | ------------                                                |
| [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) | A type-safe REST client for Android which intelligently maps an API into a client interface using annotations.            |
| [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) | A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android. |
| [ButterKnife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) | Using Java annotations, makes Android development better by simplifying common tasks. |
| [Parceler](http://parceler.org/) | Android Parcelable made easy through code generation |
| [IcePick](https://github.com/frankiesardo/icepick) | Android Instance State made easy |
| [Crouton](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton) | Context-sensitive, configurable alert notices much better than toasts |
| [Hugo](https://github.com/JakeWharton/hugo) | Easier logging using annotations |
| [LeakCanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary) | Catch memory leaks in your apps | 

Keep in mind that the combination of these libraries may not always play nicely with each other.  The following section highlights some of these issues.

#### Parceler and IcePick

Note that you cannot use IcePick at the current time to save state of Parceler objects.  See this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/frankiesardo/icepick/issues/36) for more context.  You will need to use Parcelable objects with IcePick.

#### ButterKnife and Parceler

Using the Butterknife library with the Parceler library causes multiple declarations of javax.annotation.processing.Processor.  In this case, you have to exclude this conflict in your `app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
   packagingOptions {

        exclude 'META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor'  // butterknife
    }
```

#### ButterKnife and Custom Views

Often you may find that using Butterknife or Dagger injections defined in your constructor prevent Android Studio to preview your Custom View layout.  You may see an error about needing `isEditMode()` defined.
Essentially this method is used to enable your code to short-circuit before executing a section of code that might be used for run-time but cannot be executed within the preview window.

```java
  public ContentEditorView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);

        LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) context
                .getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);

        inflater.inflate(R.layout.view_custom, this, true);

        // short circuit here inside the layout editor
        if(isInEditMode()) {
            return;
        }

        ButterKnife.inject(this);
```
