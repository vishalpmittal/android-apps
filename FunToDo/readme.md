# Pre-work - *FunToDo*

**FunToDo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Vishal Mittal**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [ ] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [ ] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Check if the user entered empty todo item
* [ ] Check if the user deleted item string while editing


The following **optional** features are **work in progress**:

* [ ] Undo deleted items
* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

## Notes

It's a great exercise to learn how to start building an android application. Thanks to Codepath for providing instructions for creating this app.
For a person like me who has java development experience, the biggest hurdle is to setup the environment and understand the flow. After that android studio makes it really easy to design the app and add functionality to it.
